## Current

- Simple area comparison based on:
  - Area
  - Quantity
- Crust taken into account
- Initial Metric/Imperial attempt

## Upcoming

- Pricing
- Calories
- Metric/Imperial improvements (more accuracy?)
- Better UI
- Refactoring and organising. JS is currently a mess, especially the ouput messages.
- SASS and use a bundler?
